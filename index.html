         <p>Miriam Makeba, affectionately known as “Mama Africa,” was a South African singer and civil rights activist who introduced Xhosa and Zulu songs to Western audiences.</p>
         <p><i>“I’m not a political singer. I don’t know what the word means. People think I consciously decided to tell the world what was happening in South Africa… No! I was singing about my life, and in South Africa we always sang about what was happening to us – especially the things that hurt us…”</i></p>
   
         <p id="early life">Early Life - Zenzile Miriam Makeba was born on 4 March 1932 in Johannesburg. From a young age, Makeba loved to sing at church, and performed her first solo during the 1947 Royal Visit. She began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, then the Manhattan Brothers, and later an all-woman group, the Skylarks Makeba’s appearances in the films Come Back Africa (1957) and King Kong (1959) cemented her reputation in the music industry both locally and abroad. She was exiled in 1960 from South Africa because of her music and her strong beliefs against the apartheid regime. As a result, she was not able to attend her mother’s funeral.</p>
